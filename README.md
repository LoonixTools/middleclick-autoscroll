# middleclick-autoscroll

Middle-click autoscroll is a CLI for Linux that enables autoscroll in every application that supports it.
Works with browsers, Electron apps like Discord and Spotify, Steam, and anything else that runs on Chromium under the hood.

There is no app list. My tool just looks at what uses chromium under the hood and applies the necessary steps to get it working.

## How to use

Just run `middleclick-autoscroll`. This will open the configuration TUI that looks like this:

## How it works

Blink (the engine in Chromium, Electron, and CEF) already has autoscroll, but
it's off on Linux because middle click does primary-selection paste there. This
flag turns it on:

--enable-blink-features=MiddleClickAutoscroll

But doing that for every app is kinda bothersome and it also might break with updates.
That's why I created this small tool to automate that.

New apps are picked up by a systemd path unit that watches the
relevant directories. Without systemd, `middleclick-autoscroll apply` does the
same thing manually.

## Steam

Steam's web UI supports autoscroll but has no way to pass extra arguments to its
helper, so the program patches the script that starts it. Steam checks its own
files at every start and repairs whatever looks changed, so the patch is written
to look unchanged.

As a fallback, for the case where that isn't possible, `-noverifyfiles` goes on
everything that starts Steam: its launcher, its autostart entry, and the
shortcuts it writes for single games. That one means Steam won't auto-repair
damaged files on its own just so you're aware of that.

## Commands

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `middleclick-autoscroll` | Interactive menu |
| `… enable` | Turn on, apply, start watching |
| `… disable` | Undo everything |
| `… apply` | Apply to new apps |
| `… apply --rebuild` | Redo from scratch |
| `… status` | What's covered |
| `… list` | All apps and how they're handled |

## Building from source

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

Optionally needs `msgfmt` (gettext) for translations and `scdoc` for the man
page. Supports `PREFIX` and `DESTDIR`. `make check` runs syntax checks and
shellcheck.
